# Introduction:
The Cryogenic Measurement System was designed and installed at ABBNIROO in 2016 for a Cryogenic Plants-Air Separation process in a petrochemical plant. The project was initiated to improve the efficiency and productivity of the process by providing reliable and accurate measurements in an extreme temperature environment.
The Cryogenic Plants-Air Separation process involves the separation of gases using extreme temperatures, with the cold box being a crucial component of the process responsible for generating liquid nitrogen. The cold box operates at temperatures as low as -176°C, making it a challenging environment for measurement and control systems.
To address this challenge, We designed and installed a specialized Cryogenic Measurement System that could operate in this extreme temperature environment. The system was designed using a combination of FPGA and microcontroller, with a magnetic reluctance sensor used for sensing magnetic field changes in the cryogenic system.

# Hardware Design:
In the design of a cryogenic measurement system, selecting the right hardware and software tools is crucial to ensuring accurate measurements in extreme temperatures. The choice of hardware design tools can greatly influence the performance and reliability of the system.
For the cryogenic measurement system, we chose to use Altium Designer for schematic capture and printed circuit board (PCB) layout. Altium Designer is a powerful and versatile tool that enables designers to create complex mixed-signal and high-speed digital designs with ease.
One of the challenges in the design of the measurement system was dealing with the extreme temperatures involved. To compensate for the effects of the cryogenic temperatures on the magnetic reluctance sensor, we needed to use an FPGA and microcontroller to read and process the sensor data. Altium Designer's mixed-signal design capabilities were invaluable in the integration of the FPGA and microcontroller into the design.

signal integrity issues early in the design phase, allowing us to make the necessary adjustments before fabrication.
The SPICE software allowed us to perform mixed-signal simulation of the design before prototyping. This enabled us to verify the performance of the system before fabrication and ensure that it met the required specifications.
